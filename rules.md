# Goro Goro Shogi

A modern small variant developed in 2012 as a way to help young kids in Japan to learn modern Shogi.
This game is played on a 5Ã—6 board with a limited selection of pieces, but unlike Minishogi and Judkins Shogi,
there are three Pawns per side instead of just one.

# Goro Goro Plus

A fantastic little variant that takes Goro Goro and gives each player a Lance and Knight in hand at the start of the game,
available for drops.  This addition really spices up the game and makes Goro Goro more than just a Shogi learning tool,
and turns it into an exciting game in its own right.
